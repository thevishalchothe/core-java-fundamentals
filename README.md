# Core Java Fundamentals 🔥😀👨‍💻

A comprehensive Core Java project showcasing fundamental concepts such as basic output programs, arithmetic operations using various data types, using user defined methods, user input handling, and object-oriented principles like class design and method overriding. 👨‍💻🎯

## ✅ What's Included:

✔️ **Basic Examples**: *(get started with Java syntax)*  
  - Simple programs demonstrating output and programs like `"Hello and welcome!"` to help understand basic structure (class, main method, and output).

✔️ **Arithmetic Operations**: *(get to Learn how arithmetic works with different data types, methods in Java)*  
  - Addition of Two Numbers, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division programs
      - using different data types: `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `short`
      - Programs using methods: ➤ 1.  With Return Type and With Parameters ➤ 2. With Return Type and Without Parameters ➤ 3. Without Return Type and With Parameters ➤ 4. Without Return Type and Without Parameters

  - Each example includes:
    - Variable declaration  
    - Initialization  
    - Arithmetic logic (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)  
    - Output statement displaying the result.
      
✔️ **Simple Scheme Form Project**: *(commercialscheme-portal)*  
  - A basic Java console application to capture and display **Person** and **Address** details.  
  - Demonstrates the use of:
    - `Scanner` class for taking user input  
    - Custom `Person` and `Address` classes with fields  
    - Overridden `toString()` methods for meaningful object output  
  - For understanding user input handling and object representation in Java.
