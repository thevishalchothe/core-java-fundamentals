# Core Java Fundamentals 🔥😀👨‍💻

A comprehensive Core Java project showcasing fundamental concepts such as basic output programs, arithmetic operations using various data types, using user defined methods, user input handling, and object-oriented principles like class design and method overriding. 👨‍💻🎯

## ✅ What's Included:

✔️ **Basic Examples**: *(get started with Java syntax)*  
  - Simple programs demonstrating output and programs like `"Hello and welcome!"` to help understand basic structure (class, main method, and output).

✔️ **Arithmetic Operations**: *(get to Learn how arithmetic works with different data types, methods in Java)*  
  - Addition of Two Numbers, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division programs
    - Using different data types: `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `short`
  - Programs using methods: ✦ `With Return Type & With Parameters` ✦ `With Return Type & Without Parameters` ✦ `Without Return Type & With Parameters` ✦ `Without Return Type & Without Parameters`

  - Each example includes: Variable declaration, Initialization, Arithmetic logic, Output statement displaying the result.

 ✔️ **Increment/Decrement Operators** 🔁

- Pre-increment (`++x`) & Post-increment (`x++`)  
- Pre-decrement (`--x`) & Post-decrement (`x--`)  
- Demonstrates differences in evaluation order  
- Real-time examples to visualize how these affect variable values

✔️ **Relational Operators** 🔎

- Comparison between variables using:  
    - `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`,  
  - Programs to evaluate conditions and return Boolean values
  - for control structures like `if`, `if-else ladder`, and `nested if.`
- **Less Than (<)**  
   - *Age Restriction* : Check if a user is too young to access specific content.  
   - *Stock Monitoring* : Alert if inventory falls below a minimum threshold.  
   - *Grading* : Determine if a score is below a passing grade.  
   - *Deadline Check* : Verify if a project completion date is before the due date.  
   - *Speed Violation* : Detect if a vehicle's speed is below the minimum limit for a highway.  

✔️ **String Concatenation Operators** 🧵➕

- Combine and manipulate strings using:
  - `+` operator to join strings  
  - `+=` for appending  
  - Mixing strings with numbers and variables
    
✔️ **Commercial Scheme System Project**: *(commercialscheme-portal)*  
  - A basic Java console application to capture and display details, with Custom `Person` and `Address` classes with fields

✔️ **Product Review System Project** *(e-commerceProductReview)*
  - A basic Java console application to simulate an e-commerce-style product review system, with Custom `Product`, `User`, and `Review` classes with fields  
 
  - Demonstrates the use of:
    - `Scanner` class for taking user input  
    - Overridden `toString()` methods for clear and meaningful object output  
  - For understanding class relationships, object creation, user input handling, and simple usage in Java.
