# Core Java Fundamentals 🔥😀👨‍💻

A comprehensive Core Java project showcasing fundamental concepts such as basic output programs, arithmetic operations using various data types, using user defined methods, user input handling, and object-oriented principles like class design and method overriding. 👨‍💻🎯

## ✅ What's Included:

✔️ **Basic Examples**: *(get started with Java syntax)*  
  - Simple programs demonstrating output and programs like `"Hello and welcome!"` to help understand basic structure (class, main method, and output).

✔️ **Arithmetic Operations**: *(get to Learn how arithmetic works with different data types, methods in Java)*  
  - Addition of Two Numbers, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division programs
    - Using different data types: `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `short`
    - Programs using methods: ➤ 1.  With Return Type and With Parameters ➤ 2. With Return Type and Without Parameters ➤ 3. Without Return Type and With Parameters ➤ 4. Without Return Type and Without Parameters

  - Each example includes: `Variable declaration`, `Initialization`, `Arithmetic logic (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)`, `Output statement displaying the result.`
      
✔️ **Commercial Scheme System Project**: *(commercialscheme-portal)*  
  - A basic Java console application to capture and display details, with Custom `Person` and `Address` classes with fields

✔️ **Product Review System Project** *(e-commerceProductReview)*
  - A basic Java console application to simulate an e-commerce-style product review system, with Custom `Product`, `User`, and `Review` classes with fields  
 
  - Demonstrates the use of:
    - `Scanner` class for taking user input  
    - Overridden `toString()` methods for clear and meaningful object output  
  - For understanding class relationships, object creation, user input handling, and simple usage in Java.
